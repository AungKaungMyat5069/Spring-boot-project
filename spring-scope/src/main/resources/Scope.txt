//Scope
Scope have Singleton, Prototype
Spring bean's scope are default in Singleton

//behavior
behavior have two type, edger and lazy
spring bean behavior is default edger
//edger - edger mean it will created object even not calling it
// lazy - lazy mean it will not created object util call it
Singleton is Edger and Prototype is Lazy
Singleton can change lazy

//Changing
//@ComponentScan(lazyInit = true(default 'false')) - All bean will be lazy
//But Only ONe single be like
//@Component @Lazy(true)

Prototype can not be change Edger unless that have Autowired

@Lazy can be used in @Component @Configuration @Bean

@Bean will good for dependence like prettyTime
